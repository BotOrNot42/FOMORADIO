## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Current Framework Components
The FOMO Radio Framework currently integrates the following technologies:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Twitter v2 APIs are used to fetch data for aggregation and analysis.

2. **AI Models**:  
   OpenAI's GPT models are used for natural language processing and summarization.

3. **Voice Generation**:  
   ElevenLabs is used for generating high-quality, natural-sounding voice outputs.

### How to Use Alternative Services
If you'd like to use other data collection sources, AI models, or voice generation tools, you'll need to make changes to the following files:

1. **Data Collection (Twitter v2 API)**:  
   Update the integration logic in the `data_collection.py` file. Replace Twitter API endpoints with your preferred data source APIs.

2. **AI Models (OpenAI)**:  
   Modify the AI model integration in `ai_processing.py`. Replace the OpenAI API calls with the corresponding SDK or API calls for your desired AI service.

3. **Voice Generation (ElevenLabs)**:  
   Update the voice synthesis logic in `voice_generation.py`. Replace ElevenLabs API calls with your preferred text-to-speech service.

### Example:
If you're replacing Twitter API with a news API:  
1. Replace the Twitter API fetch logic in `data_collection.py` with requests to the news API.
2. Adjust the data parsing logic to match the new API's response format.

If you're switching to another AI model like **Anthropic** or **Llama**:  
1. Update API calls in `ai_processing.py` to integrate the alternative AI model.
2. Ensure the prompt structure is compatible with the new model.

If you're switching to another voice generation tool like **Amazon Polly**:  
1. Update the `voice_generation.py` file to use Amazon Polly‚Äôs SDK or API.  
2. Adjust settings like voice type, language, and speed to match your requirements.
